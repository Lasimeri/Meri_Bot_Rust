## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Current Status
- **Basic commands** (`/ping`, `/echo`, `/help`, `/clearcontext`, `/clearreasoncontext`) are fully functional
- **AI commands** (`/lm`, `/reason`, `/sum`, `/rank`) are currently placeholder implementations
- For full AI functionality, continue using:
  - Prefix commands: `^lm`, `^reason`, `^sum`, `^rank`
  - Bot mentions: `<@Bot> <prompt>`

### Private Message Support
- All slash commands work in private messages (DMs)
- No prefix required - just type `/` and select the command
- Commands are automatically registered when the bot starts

## üöÄ Future Updates

The following features are planned for future updates:
- Full AI integration for `/lm` command
- Complete reasoning functionality for `/reason` command
- Document summarization for `/sum` command
- Content ranking analysis for `/rank` command

## üí° Tips

1. **Auto-completion**: Discord will show available commands when you type `/`
2. **Parameter hints**: Required parameters are marked with asterisks (*)
3. **Error handling**: Invalid commands will show helpful error messages
4. **Context clearing**: Use `/clearcontext` and `/clearreasoncontext` to reset your conversation history
5. **Help system**: Use `/help` anytime to see all available commands

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Commands not appearing
- Make sure the bot has the `applications.commands` scope when invited
- Commands may take up to 1 hour to appear globally
- Try restarting the bot to re-register commands

### Permission errors
- Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions in your server
- Check that the bot can send messages in the channel

### AI commands not working
- AI slash commands are currently placeholder implementations
- Use prefix commands (`^lm`, `^reason`) or bot mentions for full AI functionality
- Check the bot's configuration files for AI model settings
