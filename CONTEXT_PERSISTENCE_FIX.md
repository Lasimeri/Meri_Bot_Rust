# Context Persistence and Clearing Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. CTRL+C Context Loss
**Problem**: When the bot was stopped with CTRL+C, conversation contexts from `^lm` and `^reason` commands were not being saved to disk, causing users to lose their conversation history.

**Solution**: Fixed the shutdown handling to ensure contexts are properly saved before the bot exits.

### 2. Context Clearing Reliability
**Problem**: The `^clearreasoncontext` command and other context clearing functions weren't immediately persisting the cleared state to disk, potentially causing issues if the bot restarted before the next save.

**Solution**: Added immediate disk persistence after context clearing operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed CTRL+C Shutdown Handling (`src/main.rs`)

#### Before:
```rust
async fn handle_shutdown(signal: &str) {
    println!("Received '{}' signal, stopping bot gracefully...", signal);
    // Force exit after a short delay to ensure cleanup completes
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    std::process::exit(0); // ❌ Exits immediately without cleanup
}
```

#### After:
```rust
async fn handle_shutdown(signal: &str) {
    println!("Received '{}' signal, stopping bot gracefully...", signal);
    // Note: The actual cleanup is handled in the main function after this returns
    // This function just logs the signal and returns to allow proper cleanup
}
```

#### Main Function Changes:
```rust
// Main event loop - wait for shutdown signal or client error
let shutdown_reason = tokio::select! {
    _ = signal::ctrl_c() => {
        handle_shutdown("SIGINT").await;
        "SIGINT"
    }
    // ... other cases
};

// Cleanup and shutdown with context persistence
println!("Initiating graceful shutdown: {}", shutdown_reason);
cleanup_and_shutdown(&client, cmd_task, terminal_child).await;
```

### 2. Enhanced Context Saving (`src/main.rs`)

#### Improved Logging:
```rust
println!("Saving conversation contexts to disk...");
println!("  - LM contexts: {} users", lm_contexts.len());
println!("  - Reason contexts: {} users", reason_contexts.len());
println!("  - Global LM context: {} total messages", global_lm_context.total_messages());

if let Err(e) = save_contexts_to_disk(&lm_contexts, &reason_contexts, &global_lm_context).await {
    eprintln!("Failed to save contexts to disk: {}", e);
} else {
    println!("✅ Contexts saved successfully to disk");
}
```

### 3. Immediate Context Persistence After Clearing

#### `^clearreasoncontext` Command (`src/commands/reason.rs`):
- Added verification logging to confirm context is cleared
- Added immediate disk persistence after clearing
- Updated success message to indicate the cleared state was saved

#### `^lm --clear` Command (`src/commands/lm.rs`):
- Added immediate disk persistence after clearing personal context
- Updated success message to indicate the cleared state was saved

#### `^lm --clear-global` Command (`src/commands/lm.rs`):
- Added immediate disk persistence after clearing global context
- Updated success message to indicate the cleared state was saved

#### `^clearcontext` Command (`src/commands/lm.rs`):
- Added immediate disk persistence after clearing personal context
- Updated success message to indicate the cleared state was saved

### 4. Enhanced Context Clearing Verification

#### Before:
```rust
context.clear();
message_count > 0
```

#### After:
```rust
let context_info = context.get_context_info();
println!("[clearcontext] Clearing reason context for user {}: {}", user_id, context_info);

// Clear the context completely
context.clear();

// Verify the context was cleared
let after_clear_info = context.get_context_info();
println!("[clearcontext] Context after clearing: {}", after_clear_info);
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Reliable Context Persistence**
- Contexts are now saved to disk before any shutdown (CTRL+C, quit command, or error)
- No more lost conversation history when the bot restarts

### 2. **Immediate Context Clearing**
- When users clear their context, the cleared state is immediately saved to disk
- Prevents issues where cleared contexts might reappear after bot restart

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Users get confirmation that their context clearing was saved
- Clear feedback about what's happening during shutdown

### 4. **Improved Debugging**
- Enhanced logging shows exactly what contexts are being saved
- Verification logging confirms context clearing operations

## Testing

### Test CTRL+C Context Persistence:
1. Start a conversation with `^lm` or `^reason`
2. Send a few messages to build context
3. Press CTRL+C to stop the bot
4. Restart the bot
5. Verify your conversation context is still there

### Test Context Clearing:
1. Start a conversation with `^lm` or `^reason`
2. Send a few messages to build context
3. Use `^clearreasoncontext` or `^lm --clear`
4. Verify the success message mentions "saved"
5. Restart the bot
6. Verify the context is still cleared

## Files Modified

1. **`src/main.rs`** - Fixed shutdown handling and enhanced context saving
2. **`src/commands/reason.rs`** - Enhanced context clearing with immediate persistence
3. **`src/commands/lm.rs`** - Enhanced all context clearing commands with immediate persistence

## Context Files Created

The bot now creates these files in the `contexts/` directory:
- `lm_contexts.json` - Personal LM conversation history
- `reason_contexts.json` - Personal reasoning conversation history  
- `global_lm_context.json` - Shared global conversation history
