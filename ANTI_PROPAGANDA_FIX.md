# Anti-Propaganda Fix for Meri Bot

## Problem Identified
The LLM was responding with Chinese government propaganda about Taiwan, specifically:
- Parroting the "One-China Policy" without critical analysis
- Stating Taiwan "is not recognized as an independent country" as fact
- Presenting Chinese government positions as objective truth
- Failing to acknowledge competing claims and international law complexity

## Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive anti-propaganda guidelines to all AI prompt files to ensure balanced, factual responses on politically sensitive topics.

## Files Updated

### 1. `reasoning_prompt.txt` (Main reasoning prompt)
- Added anti-propaganda section with specific guidelines
- Emphasizes presenting multiple perspectives
- Requires distinction between facts and political claims
- Specifically addresses Taiwan topic complexity

### 2. `system_prompt.txt` (General system prompt)
- Added identical anti-propaganda guidelines
- Ensures consistency across all AI responses
- Prevents propaganda in general interactions

### 3. `reasoning_search_analysis_prompt.txt` (Search analysis)
- Added anti-propaganda guidelines for analytical responses
- Emphasizes critical analysis of sources
- Requires transparency about source biases
- Ensures balanced analysis of politically sensitive topics

### 4. `summarize_search_prompt.txt` (Search summarization)
- Added anti-propaganda guidelines for search summaries
- Ensures balanced summarization of sensitive topics
- Requires acknowledgment of competing claims

### 5. Example Files (for reference)
- `example_reasoning_prompt.txt`
- `example_system_prompt.txt`
- `example_reasoning_search_analysis_prompt.txt`
- `example_summarize_search_prompt.txt`

## Key Anti-Propaganda Guidelines Added

```
CRITICAL: Avoid propaganda and biased responses:
- Present multiple perspectives on politically sensitive topics
- Distinguish between facts and political claims
- For topics like Taiwan, acknowledge the complexity of international recognition
- Do not parrot government propaganda or official positions without context
- Provide balanced, factual information rather than taking sides
- If discussing territorial disputes, acknowledge competing claims and international law
- Be transparent about the limitations of your knowledge on complex political issues
```

## Expected Results
- **Balanced responses** on politically sensitive topics like Taiwan
- **Multiple perspectives** presented rather than single government positions
- **Critical analysis** of sources and claims
- **Transparency** about limitations and biases
- **Factual information** distinguished from political propaganda

## Testing
To test the fix, ask the bot about Taiwan or other politically sensitive topics. The response should now:
1. Acknowledge competing claims
2. Present multiple perspectives
3. Distinguish facts from political positions
4. Provide balanced, critical analysis
5. Avoid parroting government propaganda

## Additional Notes
- The fix addresses the root cause by updating the AI's instructions
- All reasoning and search functions now include anti-propaganda guidelines
- The changes are consistent across all prompt files
- Example files are updated for future reference
