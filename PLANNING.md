## 🧠 Intelligent Search Trigger Integration Complete

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

The Discord bot now features an intelligent search trigger system that automatically performs web searches when the AI doesn't know the answer to a user's question. This creates a seamless experience where users get either AI knowledge or current web information without manual mode switching.

### 🎯 How the Search Trigger Works

**Intelligent Decision Flow:**
1. **Knowledge Check** - AI evaluates if it has knowledge about the user's query
2. **Trigger Detection** - If AI responds with exactly `__SEARCH__`, search is automatically triggered
3. **Seamless Search** - User sees: "🧠 AI doesn't know this - searching the web..."
4. **AI-Enhanced Results** - Performs the full AI-enhanced search pipeline
5. **Fallback Layers** - Multiple fallback strategies ensure robust operation

**User Experience Examples:**

**Knowledge Available (Normal Chat):**
```
User: ^lm How do I create a Rust variable?
Bot: 🤖 Generating response...

In Rust, you create variables using the `let` keyword...
```

**Knowledge Missing (Automatic Search Trigger):**
```
User: ^lm What's the latest news about Rust 1.75?
Bot: 🧠 AI doesn't know this - searching the web...
     🧠 Refining search query...
     🔍 Searching with optimized query...
     🤖 Generating AI summary...

   - Updated `system_prompt.txt` and `example_system_prompt.txt`
   - Added search trigger instruction: "If you do not know the answer... respond with exactly __SEARCH__"
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing prompts

2. **✅ Chat Logic Modification**
   - Added initial knowledge check before streaming response
   - Uses `chat_completion()` with 16-token limit for efficiency

   - Updates Discord messages with clear progress indicators

4. **✅ Robust Fallback Strategy**
   - **Primary**: AI-enhanced search with query refinement and summarization
   - **Secondary**: Basic DuckDuckGo search with formatted results
   - **Tertiary**: Error message with troubleshooting guidance
   - **Quaternary**: Fallback to normal AI chat if search completely fails

5. **✅ Unit Testing**

**Robust Operation:**
- 🛡️ Multiple fallback layers prevent total failure
- 📋 Comprehensive error handling with user guidance
- 🔧 Efficient token usage (16 tokens for knowledge check)
- 🔄 Graceful degradation when components are unavailable

### 🚀 Testing Scenarios

**Normal AI Chat (No Search Trigger):**
```bash
^lm Hello, how are you?
^lm How do I write a for loop in Rust?

```

**Search Trigger Scenarios:**
```bash
^lm What's the latest news about SpaceX Starship?

- Model doesn't follow trigger instruction (continues with normal chat)

### 🔧 Configuration Requirements

**For Full Functionality:**
- `system_prompt.txt` with search trigger instructions (✅ provided)
- `lmapiconf.txt` with LM Studio/Ollama configuration
- `refine_search_prompt.txt` and `summarize_search_prompt.txt` (optional)
- Running LM Studio or Ollama instance with loaded model

**Fallback Behavior:**

- Clear error messages guide users through setup issues

This intelligent search trigger system transforms the Discord bot into a comprehensive knowledge assistant that seamlessly combines AI expertise with current web information, providing users with the best possible answers regardless of the question type! 🤖🔍✨

## 📁 Robust Text File Handling System Complete

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

The Discord bot now features a comprehensive, robust text file handling system that ensures consistent and reliable configuration and prompt loading across all modules.

### 🛠️ **Code Organization Improvements**

**Moved AI-Enhanced Search to `search.rs`:**
- Centralized all search-related functionality in a dedicated module
- Functions moved: `load_refine_search_prompt()`, `load_summarize_search_prompt()`, `refine_search_query()`, `summarize_search_results()`, `perform_basic_search()`, `perform_ai_enhanced_search()`, `handle_search_trigger()`, `load_lm_config()`
- Better separation of concerns and cleaner code architecture

### 📂 **Standardized Multi-Path File Loading**

**4-Path Search Pattern for Configuration:**
```rust
let paths = [
    "filename.txt",           // Current directory
    "../filename.txt",        // Parent directory  
    "../../filename.txt",     // Grandparent directory
    "src/filename.txt"        // Source directory
];
```

**8-Path Search Pattern for Prompts:**
```rust
let paths = [
    "custom_prompt.txt",           // Custom prompts (4 paths)
    "../custom_prompt.txt", 
    "../../custom_prompt.txt",
    "src/custom_prompt.txt",
    "example_custom_prompt.txt",   // Fallback to examples (4 paths)
    "../example_custom_prompt.txt",
    "../../example_custom_prompt.txt", 
    "src/example_custom_prompt.txt",
];
```

### 🔧 **Enhanced File Processing Features**

**BOM Handling:**
- Automatic detection and removal of UTF-8 BOM characters
- Prevents configuration parsing errors from text editor artifacts
- Applied consistently across all file loading functions

**Comprehensive Error Messages:**
- Shows which paths were searched when files not found
- Identifies which file was successfully loaded and from where
- Clear guidance for users on where to place configuration files

**Consistent Logging:**
- Real-time feedback showing which configuration files are loaded
- Module-specific logging with clear source identification
- Detailed path resolution information for debugging

### 🎯 **Updated Modules**

**`src/search.rs` (Comprehensive Search Module):**
- ✅ All search functionality centralized with robust file loading
- ✅ Multi-path configuration and prompt loading
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and user guidance
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for file loading paths

**`src/lm.rs` (Streamlined Chat Module):**

- ✅ Consistent error handling and logging

**`src/reason.rs` (Enhanced Reasoning Module):**
- ✅ Updated imports to use search module types
- ✅ Robust config loading with better error messages
- ✅ Multi-path prompt loading with comprehensive fallback

### 🧪 **Testing and Validation**

**Comprehensive Test Suite:**
- ✅ **9/9 Tests Passing** including new file loading path validation
- ✅ **Clean Compilation** with no warnings or errors
- ✅ **Path Resolution Tests** verify correct search order
- ✅ **BOM Handling Tests** ensure proper character encoding
- ✅ **Error Handling Tests** validate graceful failure modes

**File Loading Tests:**
```rust
test_config_loading_paths()     // Validates 4-path config search
test_prompt_loading_paths()     // Validates 8-path prompt search  
test_clean_html_text()          // HTML processing validation
test_search_result_creation()   // Search result handling
```

### 🛡️ **Robust Error Handling**

**Configuration Loading:**
- Graceful degradation when files are missing
- Clear error messages indicating which files and paths were tried
- Fallback prompts ensure functionality even without custom files
- Module-specific error context for easier troubleshooting

**Fallback Strategy:**
```
1. Custom files in current directory
2. Custom files in parent directories  
3. Example files in current directory
4. Example files in parent directories
5. Built-in fallback prompts (search functionality)
6. Clear error messages with setup guidance
```

### 🎯 **Key Benefits Achieved**

**Consistent User Experience:**
- All file loading works the same way across the entire codebase
- Predictable behavior regardless of deployment structure
- Clear feedback when configuration files are missing or found
