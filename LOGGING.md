# Enhanced Logging System Documentation

## Overview

The Meri Bot Rust includes a comprehensive logging system that provides complete visibility into bot operations. Every command execution, processing step, and error condition is logged with detailed context, making debugging and monitoring straightforward and effective.

## üéØ Key Features

### üìä Comprehensive Coverage
- **Every command execution** is logged with unique UUIDs for tracking
- **Phase-based logging** with clear step indicators
- **Performance metrics** including character counts and processing times
- **Error diagnosis** with detailed context and recovery suggestions
- **User experience tracking** for command usage patterns
- **Real-time monitoring** during streaming operations

### üîç Log Levels
- **TRACE** - Most detailed level, shows every step and data transformation
- **DEBUG** - Detailed debugging information for development
- **INFO** - General operational information
- **WARN** - Warning conditions that don't stop operation
- **ERROR** - Error conditions that may affect functionality

### üìÅ Log Storage
- All logs are saved to `log.txt` in the project root
- Persistent storage across bot restarts
- Automatic log rotation and management
- Human-readable timestamps and formatting

## üöÄ Logging Configuration

### Environment Setup
The logging system is configured via the `RUST_LOG` environment variable in `botconfig.txt`:

```
RUST_LOG=info
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- `info` - Standard operational logging (default)
- `debug` - Detailed logging for production monitoring
- `trace` - Full visibility for development and debugging (can be enabled in `src/main.rs`)
- `warn` - Only warnings and errors
- `error` - Only error conditions

### Log File Location
- **Primary**: `log.txt` in the project root directory
- **Automatic Creation**: Log file is created automatically on first run
- **Persistent**: Logs are preserved across bot restarts

### Enabling Trace Logging
To enable trace logging for detailed debugging:

1. **Edit `src/main.rs`** (around line 810):
   ```rust
   // Change from:
   std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "info");
   
   // To:
   std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "trace");
   ```

2. **Recompile and restart** the bot
3. **Check `log.txt`** for detailed trace-level logs
4. **Remember to disable** trace logging in production for performance

## üìã Command-Specific Logging

### üéØ User ID Mention Logging
The primary interaction method includes comprehensive logging:

```rust
// Example log entries for user mentions

## üîß Log Analysis and Debugging

### Finding Specific Requests
Search for UUIDs to track specific command executions:
```bash
grep "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" log.txt
```

### Error Analysis
Find all errors in the log:
```bash
grep "ERROR" log.txt
```

### Performance Analysis
Find slow requests:
```bash
grep "Total processing time" log.txt | grep -E "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ seconds"
```

### User Activity Tracking
Find all interactions from a specific user:
```bash
grep "User: Alice" log.txt
```

### Vision Analysis Tracking
Find all vision-related operations:
```bash
grep "GIF_VISION\|commands::vis" log.txt
```

### Search Operation Tracking
Find all search-related operations:
```bash
grep "search\|SerpAPI" log.txt
```

## üìà Log File Management

### File Size Monitoring
The log file can grow large over time. Monitor its size:
```bash
ls -lh log.txt
```

### Log Rotation (Manual)
To prevent the log file from becoming too large:
```bash
# Archive current log
mv log.txt log.txt.$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Create new log file
touch log.txt
```

### Log Cleanup
Remove old log files:
```bash
# Remove logs older than 30 days
find . -name "log.txt.*" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Development
1. **Use TRACE level** for maximum visibility during development
2. **Search by UUID** to track specific command executions
3. **Monitor error patterns** to identify recurring issues
4. **Check performance metrics** to optimize slow operations
5. **Track vision processing** for image analysis debugging

### For Production
1. **Use DEBUG or INFO level** to balance visibility and performance
2. **Monitor log file size** and implement rotation if needed
3. **Set up log monitoring** to alert on error conditions
4. **Archive logs regularly** for historical analysis
5. **Monitor API usage** for rate limiting and quota management

### For Troubleshooting
1. **Start with ERROR level** to identify critical issues
2. **Use UUID tracking** to follow specific user requests
3. **Check configuration loading** logs for setup issues
4. **Monitor network and API** logs for connectivity problems
5. **Review vision processing** logs for image analysis issues

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter logging issues:

1. **Check log file permissions** - Ensure the bot can write to `log.txt`
2. **Verify RUST_LOG setting** - Make sure it's set in `botconfig.txt`
3. **Check disk space** - Ensure there's room for log file growth
4. **Review recent changes** - New features may add logging requirements
5. **Search existing logs** - Look for similar issues in the log history
6. **Check vision dependencies** - Ensure image processing libraries are available
7. **Verify API keys** - Check SerpAPI and other service configurations

The enhanced logging system provides complete visibility into bot operations, making it easy to diagnose issues, monitor performance, and understand user interactions across all features including the new vision analysis capabilities.
