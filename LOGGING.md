# Enhanced Logging System Documentation

## Overview

The Meri Bot Rust includes a comprehensive logging system that provides complete visibility into bot operations. Every command execution, processing step, and error condition is logged with detailed context, making debugging and monitoring straightforward and effective.

## üéØ Key Features

### üìä Comprehensive Coverage
- **Every command execution** is logged with unique UUIDs for tracking
- **Phase-based logging** with clear step indicators
- **Performance metrics** including character counts and processing times
- **Error diagnosis** with detailed context and recovery suggestions
- **User experience tracking** for command usage patterns
- **Real-time monitoring** during streaming operations

### üîç Log Levels
- **TRACE** - Most detailed level, shows every step and data transformation
- **DEBUG** - Detailed debugging information for development
- **INFO** - General operational information
- **WARN** - Warning conditions that don't stop operation
- **ERROR** - Error conditions that may affect functionality

### üìÅ Log Storage
- All logs are saved to `log.txt` in the project root
- Persistent storage across bot restarts
- Automatic log rotation and management
- Human-readable timestamps and formatting

## üöÄ Logging Configuration

### Environment Setup
The logging system is configured via the `RUST_LOG` environment variable in `botconfig.txt`:

```
RUST_LOG=trace
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- `trace` - Full visibility for development and debugging
- `debug` - Detailed logging for production monitoring
- `info` - Standard operational logging
- `warn` - Only warnings and errors
- `error` - Only error conditions

### Log File Location
- **Primary**: `log.txt` in the project root directory
- **Automatic Creation**: Log file is created automatically on first run
- **Persistent**: Logs are preserved across bot restarts

## üìã Command-Specific Logging

### üéØ User ID Mention Logging
The primary interaction method includes comprehensive logging:

```rust
// Example log entries for user mentions

```

## üîß Log Analysis and Debugging

### Finding Specific Requests
Search for UUIDs to track specific command executions:
```bash
grep "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" log.txt
```

### Error Analysis
Find all errors in the log:
```bash
grep "ERROR" log.txt
```

### Performance Analysis
Find slow requests:
```bash
grep "Total processing time" log.txt | grep -E "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ seconds"
```

### User Activity Tracking
Find all interactions from a specific user:
```bash
grep "User: Alice" log.txt
```

## üìà Log File Management

### File Size Monitoring
The log file can grow large over time. Monitor its size:
```bash
ls -lh log.txt
```

### Log Rotation (Manual)
To prevent the log file from becoming too large:
```bash
# Archive current log
mv log.txt log.txt.$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Create new log file
touch log.txt
```

### Log Cleanup
Remove old log files:
```bash
# Remove logs older than 30 days
find . -name "log.txt.*" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Development
1. **Use TRACE level** for maximum visibility during development
2. **Search by UUID** to track specific command executions
3. **Monitor error patterns** to identify recurring issues
4. **Check performance metrics** to optimize slow operations

### For Production
1. **Use DEBUG or INFO level** to balance visibility and performance
2. **Monitor log file size** and implement rotation if needed
3. **Set up log monitoring** to alert on error conditions
4. **Archive logs regularly** for historical analysis

### For Troubleshooting
1. **Start with ERROR level** to identify critical issues
2. **Use UUID tracking** to follow specific user requests
3. **Check configuration loading** logs for setup issues
4. **Monitor network and API** logs for connectivity problems

## üîç Log Format Reference

### Standard Log Entry Format
```
[timestamp] [level] [module] [message]
```

### UUID Tracking Format
```
[timestamp] [level] [module] [UUID: uuid] [message]
```

### Performance Metric Format
```
[timestamp] [level] [module] [UUID: uuid] Statistics: [metrics]
```

### Error Format
```
[timestamp] [level] [module] [UUID: uuid] Error: [error_description]
```

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter logging issues:

1. **Check log file permissions** - Ensure the bot can write to `log.txt`
2. **Verify RUST_LOG setting** - Make sure it's set in `botconfig.txt`
3. **Check disk space** - Ensure there's room for log file growth
4. **Review recent changes** - New features may add logging requirements
5. **Search existing logs** - Look for similar issues in the log history

The enhanced logging system provides complete visibility into bot operations, making it easy to diagnose issues, monitor performance, and understand user interactions.
